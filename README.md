=============

## Purpose

This web application was built as I followed the book, Agile Web Development with Rails, by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas and David Heinemeier Hansoon.

## How it was built

The site was build on the Ruby on Rails web framework. The application is an e-commerce site that allows customers to select items, which are then placed in their shopping cart. There is also an administrative back-end, where items can be managed. The web application uses many facets of Rails, including the MVC design pattern, associations, different types of relationships between models, sessions and user authentication.
